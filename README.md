## Cognitive Modeling Project README

## Description
Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning with Bandits project! This project focuses on simulating and analyzing different types of multi-armed bandit problems using reinforcement learning techniques. Specifically, it includes binomial and Gaussian reward structures with both fixed and dynamic (walking) reward probabilities or means. The project also implements a Softmax-weighted average agent to solve these bandit problems.

Installation
To get started with the Cognitive Modeling Project, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies. When typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` into your terminal, this will be done for you.
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your local environment or Google Colab.

## Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can begin exploring the different bandit models. This project includes simulations of: Binomial rewards with fixed probabilities, Binomial rewards with walking probabilities, Gaussian rewards with fixed mean rewards, Gaussian rewards with walking mean rewards
